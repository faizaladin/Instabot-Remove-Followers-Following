There are two functions in this script:
  Function 1: Removes a set number of followers (change for loop parameters for however many followers you wish to remove) while not     
  removing anyone from the keep_followers_list.
  Function 2: Same as function 1 except it removes who you follow. This function also uses the keep_followers_list. 

In Config: Replace username and password with your instagram username and password. Install the chromdriver that matches your current version of chrome and copy the path to where it says 'DRIVER PATH'. 

Dependencies: Selenium Webdriver
